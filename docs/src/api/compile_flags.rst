Compile flags
-------------

Typically the user will not need to interact with these flags, but we document them
here for completeness.  Note this list is not exhaustive, others are not exposed
but defined in :code:`include/glbopts.h`.  The list below are defined in
:code:`scs.mk` and can be overridden via the command line when compiling by
executing, e.g., :code:`make DLONG=1`, to set the :code:`DLONG` flag to True.
